Where’d you get the coconut?  We found them. Found them? In Mercia? The coconut’s tropical!  What do you mean? Well, this is a temperate zone.  The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin9 or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?  Not at all, they could be carried. What? A swallow carrying a coconut?  It could grip it by the husk! It’s not a question of where it grips it! It’s a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.  Well, it doesn’t matter. Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the court of Camelot is here. Listen, in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right? Please! Am I right?  I’m not interested! It could be carried by an African swallow! Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow. That’s my point. Oh, yeah, I agree with that...  Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?! But then, of course, African swallows are non-migratory. Oh, yeah... So they couldn’t bring a coconut back anyway...
